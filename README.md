# Unlimit ðŸš€ðŸ“²

Unlimit is a simple tool to quickly run your app on your device without worrying about the 100 device limit per developer account set by Apple. It achieves this by **temporarily switching your Xcode Project to the `Personal Team`**.

### Why can't I just do it myself?

Well, you can, if your project is simple. However, if your project has capabilities like **Push Notifications**, **Background Modes** & **App Extensions**, things get complicated, since these require you to configure your `Personal Team` with all these entitlements. Unlimit gets rid of all this mess, and gets you quickly up and running on your device.

### What's the catch?

Well, since unlimit temporarily removes capabilities like **App Extensions, Push Notifications** & more from your project, you **can't** test these features on your device when using your personal team.

### How do I undo unlimit's changes?

We recommend you run unlimit when you have no staged changes, so that you can simple go back by running `git reset --hard` when you're done testing on your device.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'unlimit'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install && bundle exec unlimit

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install unlimit

## Usage

Just execute:

    $ bundle exec unlimit

and unlimit will do it's magic.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
